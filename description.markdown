### About marty.nerdland.info

Marty.nerdland.info is a site hosted by [Kingdon Barrett][] with the gracious assistance of Computer Science House.

The purpose of this site is to greet visitors from [android-x86.org][] and welcome/convert as many of you as possible into happy Android users.

I hope to help some of the more capable users to share their Android problem solving ability and experience in a way that is not too spammy or hard to follow.

(So this site was re/born.  In its previous incarnation it was based on [dropbox public folders][], but no more; people did not use the feature properly, and so I've removed 'thispage.php' for those of you who remember it, since you can no longer create public folders in the same way with Dropbox.

For all you who contacted me, I still have your e-mail address, I am sure.

We are on [icecream sandwich][] now from what I had gathered in X86 land, and I am personally now following the newer ARM-supporting (Tegra2) updates published by [teameos][].

This site is powered by [Wheat][], a git based blogging engine written in [node.JS][].  It's about my favorite blog software in the world, hope to learn to use it to more properly address a large audience.

The content for this site is stored in a [git repository][] that anyone can fork, write an article, and send a pull request. If your article passes the quality standards it will be published and help support the greater android community.
