### About marty.nerdland.info

Marty.nerdland.info is a site hosted by [Kingdon Barrett][] with the gracious assistance of Computer Science House.

This blog engine is based on the software from HowToNode.org, which is a community supported blog created by [Tim Caswell][].  The purpose of this site is to greet visitors from [android-x86.org][] and convert as many as possible into happy Android users.

I hope to help some of the more capable users to share their Android problem solving ability and experience in a way that is not too spammy or hard to follow.

(OK; I'll level with you.  I get so many visitors and ever since I started keeping track, I just can't bear to see them all going to a generic 404 page.  I can't keep up with the traffic on android-x86 mailing lists.  So this site was re/born.)

This site is powered by [Wheat][], a git based blogging engine written in [node.JS][].  It's about my favorite blog software in the world, but I've never learned to wield it properly, or to properly address a large audience.

The content for this site is stored in a [git repository][] that anyone can fork, write an article, and send a pull request. If your article passes the quality standards it will be published and help support the greater node community.
