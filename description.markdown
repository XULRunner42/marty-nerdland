### Spotlight

Someone update my knowledge.  What tablets are good?  Have you ever built
android on them before?  Tell us!

### Tell us about your hardware!

Are you running a variant of the Android Open Source Project, or some other
flavor of Linux or UNIX?  Tell us about your experience with Android on [your hardware][].  If you are looking for up-to-date ROMs, it will help if we know
what kind of hardware you are using.  I have an ASUS Transformer TF-101 and I
also provide a mirror of [KatKiss ROMs][] for Timduru.
