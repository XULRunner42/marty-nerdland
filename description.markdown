### Spotlight

Someone update my knowledge.  What tablets are good?  Have you ever built
android on them before?  Tell us!

### Tell us about your hardware!

Are you running a variant of the Android Open Source Project, or some other flavor of Linux or UNIX?  Tell us about your experience with Android on [your hardware][].  If you are looking for up-to-date ROMs, it will help if we know what kind of hardware you are using.  I have an ASUS Transformer TF-101 and I also provide a mirror of [KatKiss ROMs][] for Timduru.

### About marty.nerdland.info

Marty.nerdland.info is a site hosted by [Kingdon Barrett][] with the gracious assistance of Computer Science House.

Stay a while and share your problem solving ability and experience.  This site targets Android and Android-x86, Functional Programmers including the [Urbit][] community, and also [Beeminder][] users.

(So this site was re/born.  In its previous incarnation it was based on [dropbox public folders][], but no more; people did not use the feature properly, and so I've removed 'thispage.php' for those of you who remember it, since you can no longer create public folders in the same way with Dropbox.

For all you who contacted me, I still have your e-mail address, I am sure.

We are on [icecream sandwich][] now from what I had gathered in X86 land, and I am personally now following the newer ARM-supporting (Tegra2) updates published by [teameos][].

This site is powered by [Wheat][], a git based blogging engine written in [node.JS][].  It's about my favorite blog software in the world, hope to learn to use it to more properly address a large audience.

The content for this site is stored in a [git repository][] that anyone can fork, write an article, and send a pull request. If your article passes the quality standards it will be published and help support the greater android community.
