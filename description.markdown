### About marty.nerdland.info

Marty.nerdland.info is a site hosted by [Kingdon Barrett][] with the gracious
assistance of Computer Science House.

Welcome Programmers including the [Urbit][] community, and also [Beeminder][]
users.

Also, since they are awesome we are mirroring ARM-supporting (Tegra2) updates
published by [TimDuru][].

This site is powered by [Wheat][], a git based blogging engine written in
[node.JS][].  It's about my favorite blog software in the world, I hope to
address a large, diverse audience using it.

The content for this site is stored in a [git repository][] that anyone can
fork, write an article, and send a pull request.
