I wanted to make a blog to show how easy it is, and how it can be done in just a handful of minutes without PHP and without dependencies on outside web hosting companies.  I was already familiar with howtonode, so I stole their design with much fanfare, and I decided to use a name that I've been keeping for a long time, because I just paid for it again and it's not used.

## NerdLand.info

The NerdLand.info name is the second in a proud list of NerdLand names that I've had, coming after I forgot to renew the name of nerdland.org.  I heard that someone bought it.  I was not going to pay $80 to get it back, when I could just pay $10 to get another name (forward) and there don't seem to be any trademarks on NerdLand, though I have not performed an exhaustive search.

### BeeMinder

The most useful project I've seen in recent time is [beeminder][].  The goal of beeminder is to let you graph anything linear or exponential (it must have data points, they ought to refresh themselves approximately daily.)  Then once you have graphs, you can easily turn your graph into a goal, pledge money toward the goal, and get billed directly if you fail your goals.  You will get at least one reminder from BeeMinder before you fail and get billed.

Here's an example of a graph and a goal using BeeMinder: [20-minutes][].

## Conclusion

You should get as many bitcoins as you can, as soon as possible, since they seem to be experiencing exponential growth in value.  Check out bitcoin at [bitcoin][] (the bitcoin website) or any major news outlet.
