The Notion of a Wasted Vote: 
=============

The American traitor takes on a new form
-------------

I have recently found myself bombarded with this notion of 'A Wasted Vote' and I feel it necessary to just blog about 
this notion for a bit.

The Idea of a democracy is that we get to vote, power to the people! Upon a deeper look this is what Merriam-Webster  
has to say about the definition of democracy, just in case you're curious. After reading that I can see I'm treading in 
some deep waters. What is it they say about politics? Stay away from religion and politics to avoid conflict? Good thing
I'm a non-conformist with a strong notion to know the unknown.

I digress. So given the right to vote, every year not just in a presidential election year, what is this notion of 'a 
wasted vote'?  I personally plan on voting for what I believe in. Is this a way for people to say 'I don't vote unless 
it's a presidential election year and when it is I'm going to vote for the lesser of two evils, not what I truly believe
in.' Thank you. So I'm going to slip this into my little back pocket here; the notion of a wasted vote and someone who 
might hold this notion is a liar, a traitor, a non-believer. Wait those are some harsh claims, are they?

Take this. We live in a country that has a government that is ruled by the Constitution, a document that hold rights and
ways of people and government alike Merriam-Webster defines it as an established law or custom. Personally I know it is 
a document that was written by our founding fathers that was created to protect the people from Brittan rule....or some 
nonsense to the like. I'm sure you have heard the stories, maybe you have even studied it.

The Constitution on voting, well that doesn't even guarantee that the popular vote will win, or even that a state has to
offer the opportunity to vote in a popular election, however they all do. This is because the founding fathers knew that
the federal government could get too powerful if the states did not have powers of their own. The Constitution goes on 
to offer the electoral college... so the founding fathers...hmm...back in their day now we are talking 1776, over 200 
years ago with no real technology that is comparable with anything to the like we have today with all our personal 
devices, personal computers, the internet. My goodness the internet.

I conclude that the time has come for Direct Democracy, where we use the technology we have to vote. We are in the age 
of personal devices, everyone has access to the internet in one way or another. The electoral college was a system put 
into place to ensure that all people could vote, that might be a stretch, with elections being held and no real 
technology, no cars, no buses, no polling machines, I can almost understand how this might be necessary. However today 
it is not.

I have expressed this notion of Direct Democracy to others, people think that the general public is too stoopid. 
While they might be right, I am also right when I say that there are powers that be that want us to be stoopid, that don't 
want us to ask questions, or even read. That much is apparant by the no child left behind act, lets pull funding from 
schools if their kids have bad grades. Lets take their already dwindling resourses away if they can't work with what 
little we have given them in the first place.

###I vote for education, for power to the people, for the people, by the people.



That is what I truly believe the founding fathers intentions were when composing the document that becomes more and more powerless everyday known as 
'The Constitution of the United States America'.


So I guess this notion of a wasted vote might be a good argument given the way our current system works. 
The person saying that they are voting for the lesser of two evils is still self admittedly voting for evil so in my 
opinion that makes them no less of a traitor to not only my rights, but to yours as well.

Do you think your vote will be wasted?
