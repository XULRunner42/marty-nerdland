Artificial reefs in the Great Lakes have potential to provide suitable habitat
and spawning grounds for lake trout and other popular sports fish.

## Olcott Artificial Reef

The Olcott reef, located in southwestern Lake Ontario and 0.8 km offshore from
Olcott, NY, was built in 1981 to 1982 as a joint effort between the Town of
Newfane and the Niagara County Fisheries Board. The reef consists of 359 tons
of limestone, cement blocks, and red shale stone. Since the western basin of
Lake Ontario is essentially featureless, this reef provides ideal habitat for 
lake trout and warm water fish species. We hope that we can raise awareness about this structure, because not many people in Olcott know about it, and those who have just learned about it, such as people who use the Town of Newfane Marina, showed genuine interest in the reef.

At the time of this writing, inline images were not able to be made working.
All of the images can be viewed at the link above from Dropbox.

Included in this link is a photo of an historical original map of the Olcott Reef, showing the general shape and dimensions. Although the width of the reef is not explicit, I surmised that it would approximate the width of 
a standard barge, so 35'.

The Google Earth map, also contained in the link above, is from summer 2014, showing the reef coordinates and also 2 benchmark sites where we sampled, using SCUBA and dome suction sampling, benthic macroinvertebrates.

 Another historical photo shows the tugboat and barge getting ready to 
move out of Olcott Harbor and dump the reef materials to start the reef-building process.
The photo of the two people shows Mr. Rod Hedley of Hedley Boat Co., who was the founder of the Olcott Reef, and Katherine Bailey, graduate student at SUNY Brockport who is interested in learning about and restoring the reef.
