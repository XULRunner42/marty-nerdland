I'm learning to build KatKiss and I've produced a build [that should work][] ([direct link][]).  Beware!  I'm told that from how I built it, that it has an old KAT kernel (it's builtin/external and hasn't been updated in a while in the repo tree).  You are therefore better off downloading a [real KatKiss dev rom][] or [KatKiss 4.3 dev rom][] from my new mirror!
