Node: v0.10.21

Mohela, Mint, Beeminute, Credit Cards, Student Loan, Email â€” All of these
things consume my attention for a minimum of 10 minutes a day, because I don't
have a team of robots keeping track and bringing me regular status reports.
Next year we will be fixing that.

## Content

A follow-up to [Loanminder Progress part 2][], forking [URLminder][].  Also see
[Loanminder Progress][], the first article in the series.  We'll build on the
Rails project distributed via Beeminder's GitHub, URLminder, which is used to
track the number of words on this page.  I'll also take an opportunity to clean
out all of the garbage in my sidebar (description.markdown) which counts toward
that total.
