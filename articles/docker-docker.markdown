Check out this somewhat dated news that: [docker can now run within docker][]!
That's right, you know this is just exactly what you've been looking for all
this time.

## Spotlight on Jérôme Petazzoni

I went looking for a few things "with docker" and found that a lot of the
things I was looking for were already done by @jpetazzo.  Most notably for me,
check these things out on [his page at the docker index][]:

* dind: docker in docker
* openvpn: an OpenVPN service in a docker container
* docker-registry: the [index service][] itself, which you might want for your
  private images (sounds sexy!) if you are using Docker in your proprietary
  company
* pgsql and pglite: some ideas about the right amount of postgres (for me
  unfortunately there is currently no postgres as a right amount of postgres)

Thanks, Jérôme, not just for having accented characters in your name, but any other accomplishments that you have contributed to the world!
