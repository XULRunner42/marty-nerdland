I have enabled comments via the Disqus comments plugin!  Please submit your comments, so that I can consider them in the future development of this site.  Click "Read more..." below to submit a comment.

## Recap

No links in this article.  Just look below this paragraph, and if you see something that looks like a box to type in, go ahead and submit a comment (sign up for an account with Disqus, or I believe you may use your OpenID to log in.)  I will consider your comments in the future development of this site.  Looking for someone to take over that advertising spot as well.
