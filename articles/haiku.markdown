Node: v0.10.8

Haiku is really great, and I have some links I didn't want to lose!  There are
apparently VirtualBox Guest additions for Haiku.  I haven't been able to get
them to work, but here's the thread:

## Content

There is a [thread from 2011][] supposedly only works with the [gcc4 builds][]
of Haiku, but I wasn't able to get it to build.  There are also [gcc4 hybrid
builds][] that might work, I don't know any of the nuances of Haiku.  The code
for the additions is [here][] on Github, or [here2][].

Also, you can see mentions of the code moving into the VirtualBox tree now,
under the stewardship of Oracle where it was last reported to build OK nearly 9
months ago in the comments on the [scgtrp blog][] that I found by Googling.

PS. we are on Node v0.10.8 now, in FreeBSD land.
